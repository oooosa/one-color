-Pick ideas with only 1 core mechanic that is fast to develop and easy to manage
-Avoid minor details that could take much time but added value is less than 1%
	-In Zombroad adjusting car's various complex properties (suspension, tarction, mass, acceleration etc...)
	-In Topairy spending lots of time on fixing the accuracy of cutting like 
		-Fixing conditions where moving fast will make leaves hang in air
		-Setting origins for individual plant shapes
	-In Feed The Bird spending most of the time adjusting the Rope Physics
	-In Electrical Manager we spend 1 month to just test the first version because we waited to develop 5 mini games to test the game & the project was highly mismanaged that cost use huge time to fix/add further updates
